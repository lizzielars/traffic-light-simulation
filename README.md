# CMSC 335 - Object-Oriented and Concurrent Programming - Final Project

The purpose of the Java Traffic Simulation Program is to create a Java program thatdisplays time, traffic signals, and other information for traffic analysts. The program displays a the current time, three traffic lights, and a traffic data table that displays the cars’ speed and position. To exit the program, the user can simply select the “X” in the top corner of the window.
Please note, the speed of the cars is in meters per second and the distance from to each traffic light is in meters.
To compile and run this program, ensure all source files are in the same directory open that is directly in the computer’s terminal. From there, open the directory using the command ‘cd /path/to/the/directory’ and then run the command ‘javac Main.java’. Finally, run the command ‘java Main’ and the program will compile.
